# Pathfinding Application

This application is a tool that uses pathfinding algorithms to determine the shortest or most efficient path between two points on a map or within a virtual environment.

## Features
<ul>
    <li>User-friendly interface for setting the starting and ending points on the map/grid.</li>
    <li>Ability to choose between different pathfinding algorithms such as A* and Dijkstra's algorithm.</li>
    <li>Real-time display of the path as the algorithm runs.
    Option to set obstacles on the map/grid.</li>
</ul>


## Getting Started

To run the application locally:

<ol>
    <li>Clone this repository to your local machine.</li>
    <li>Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.</li>
    <li>Run npm start to start the development server and launch the application in your browser.</li>

</ol>

## Use the Application with Docker
